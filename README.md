# Common Data Structures implemented in Java

## Description
I implemented some of the most common data structures in Java for learning purposes.

### Data Structures
* ArrayList (dynamic array)
* LinkedList (one-directional)
* Stack (using static array)
* Queue (using one-directional linked list)
* Set (using static array)
* HashMap (using ArrayList which contains entries of key-value pairs)
* Heap (min-heap and max-heap)
* Priority Queue (min-heap approach)
* Binary Tree (no element ordering)
* Binary Search Tree (element ordering)
* Graph (direction supported)
